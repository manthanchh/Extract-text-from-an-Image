## Extracting text information from an Image

Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. 

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
